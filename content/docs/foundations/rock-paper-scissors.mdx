title: Rock Paper Scissors
description: Baby's first Javascript.
---

This was the first project that involved using Javascript and was done in two stages. The first iteration of Rock, Paper Scissors was a simple console app, but
later in the curriculum you are meant to create a UI.

I'll be skipping ahead slightly and re-do the UI for the game.

## Original Submission

Originally it seemed I hadn't uploaded the [project to Github](https://github.com/SQUASHD/rock-paper-scissors), but I found it in my local repository.
The commit history is a bit ["draw the rest of the owl"](https://www.valueresearchonline.com/content-assets/images/49359_20210524-vr-premium-graphic-1_1__w660__.jpg), but at least it's there.
Because it was written in vanilla Javascript I had to change up some of the code to make it more compatible with React.

It's pretty ugly too, but at least it works... sort of. The game is only meant to go up to 5 but there is no indication in the UI that you've won or lost.

[Try it](/projects/rock-paper-scissors/old) if you want.


## New Assignment

Because the game is rather simple and doesn't require a lot of logic, I think I'd like to add a bit more to it.

I'd like to connect the game to a socket server and allow two players to play against each other. That's something I've not done before and I think it would be a good learning experience.


### Components To Make

- A selection card
- Score screen
- A modal to display the winner
