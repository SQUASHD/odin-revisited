description: The first steps of my journey to become a web developer.

This was the starting point of it all! It was a hands-on introduction to all the essential tools needed to create real,
functioning websites. I learned about the tasks performed by web developers and established a solid foundation for the
subsequent courses.

This part of the course was focused on how to use Git and GitHub, how to use the command line,
the basics of HTML and CSS (flexbox) and some foundational JavaScript.

At the end of the course you are presented with the option of pursuing a fullstack course in Ruby on Rails or Javascript,
and I am forever grateful that I chose the latter. Not necessarily because I love Javascript, but the surrounding ecosystem
is so much more vibrant and exciting than Ruby's.
