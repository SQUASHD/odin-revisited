Odin Revisited is a side project I started May 2023.

I started development later than most, at the age of 26 in August 2022. I began pursuing a vocational degree in backend Programming,
but I felt the speed at which we were learning was egregiously slow. I looked for something I could study on the side, and that's
when I discovered [the Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com). Not only was it free, but it was also self-paced. I could learn at my own speed, and the structure
of _learning by doing_ was exactly what I was looking for.

I started the Odin Project September 2022 and had completed it by November 2022.

Partially motivated by seeing all my old repositories on GitHub – some of which were still shamefully pinned – I decided to revisit the Odin Project and see how much I've grown as a developer.
This way I can keep my old repositories, but also have a new one that shows my current skills.
