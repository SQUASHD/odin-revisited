description: Intentions and goals for Odin Revisited.

Odin Revisited is a side project I started May 2023. I started [the Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com) August 2022 and completed it in November 2022.

Partially motivated by seeing all my old repositories on GitHub – some of which were still shamefully pinned – I decided to revisit the Odin Project and see how much I've grown as a developer.
This way I can keep my old repositories, but also have a new one that shows my current skills.

The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know. I'm excited to see how much I've grown by the time I finish this project.
