description: Welcome to the Odin Revisited documentation.

This is the documentation for Odin Revisited.

This doc template is pulled from [Shadcn's implementation](https://tx.shadcn.com/docs) of using ContentLayer and mdx to build a doc site.
I could have opted to use [Nextra](https://nextra.site/), but I wanted to keep everything located in the same place, and the [Taxonomy](https://tx.shadcn.com) website really inspired me.
