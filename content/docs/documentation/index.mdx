description: Welcome to the Odin Revisited documentation.

This is the documentation for Odin Revisited.

This doc template is pulled from [Shadcn's implementation](https://tx.shadcn.com/docs) of using ContentLayer and mdx to build a doc site.

To prevent myself from going overboard, I will try to approach each project in a structured manner.
I will outline what I saw as the learning objective of the original assignment, what changes I wish to do and outline what I will consider a MVP that I will try to achieve before moving on to the next project.
When I've reached the MVP, I will do a retroactive and outline features that I may want to implement in the future.

## Hosting Old Projects

I will do my best to host old projects here, but because so many of them are written in Vanilla JS, the refactoring may just be too much work. I may just link to the GH pages of the original project.

Though the styling may be poor or non-existent, I will try to present the projects in the state that they were in when I submitted them.
For ease of use, I may keep the navbar and footer consistent across all projects.
