description: The Odin Project Curriculum

The Odin Project is structured as a curriculum, with each project building on the last.
It starts off with some basic HTML/CSS, then moves on to (vanilla) Javascript for some front end interactivity, before moving on to more advanced topics like Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for the back end.

Some projects/topics I'll consider being covered by another project or something I've already done, and will skip them.

## Curriculum

There are more projects and assignments, but some cover basic developer workflow, eg. Git or the command line and so won't be listed here.
