The Odin Project is structured as a curriculum, with each project building on the last.
It starts with basic HTML/CSS, then moves on to (vanilla) Javascript for some front end interactivity, before moving on to more advanced topics like Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for the back end.
I've grouped the projects into two categories: `HTML/CSS` and `Javascript`, and the order in which I completed them the first time around.
