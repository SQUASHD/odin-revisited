description: The Odin Project's very first assignment.
---

The very first assigment of the Odin Project is to [create a recipe page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes#assignment).
This assigment is preceded by an introductory lesson on [HTML and CSS](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#html-foundations).
There were no expectations of using any styling, and certainly no JavaScript. Nonetheless, I feel like my original submission was a bit too minimalistic.

## Original Submission

You can view a mostly faithful recreation of my original submission [here](/projects/old/recipes), or if you
really want to get in the weeds you can see [the repo](https://github.com/SQUASHD/odin-recipes/).

I created a landing page with a link to two recipes.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html lang="en">
		<head>
			<meta charset="UTF-8">
			<title>Odin Recipes</title>
		</head>

		<body>
			<h1>Odin Recipes</h1>
			<a href="./recipes/lasagna.html">Lasagna</a>
			<a href="./recipes/risotto.html">Risotto</a>
		</body>
	</html>
```

```html
<h1>Lasagna</h1>
<img src="../images/lasagna.jpg" alt="An image of a baked lasagna">
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Delicious lasagna</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Minced meat</li>
	<li>Bechamel sauce</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Cook minced meat</li>
	<li>Assemble</li>
</ol>
```

## New Assignment

When I first started redoing this assignment, I went slightly overboard.
I created a schema for the recipes and I was going to use a database to store them and retrieve them.
I was also going to implement some kind of authentication so that users could create their own recipes,
and was considering how I could use editorJS to allow users to create their own recipes with a WYSIWYG editor.

I quickly realized that this was way too much for a simple assignment, and that I was getting ahead of myself.

The goal of the original assigment was to simply familiarize oneself with the structure of a website, so I instead decided to create
some statically generated pages. I liked how the [Taxonomy website](https://tx.shadcn.com) used

I liked how articles and blog posts were formatted with markdown
and then rendered into HTML. I decided to do something similar, but with recipes. I had already structured the data in JSON objects and added them as fields.

### Components

- A grid of recipes on the landing page
- A card for each recipe with a photo, title, and description
- A recipe page with a photo, description, ingredients, and steps
- An accordion for the ingredients and steps

### End Result
