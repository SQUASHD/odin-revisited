title: Landing Page
description: The first introduction to styling HTML elements with CSS.

Another project I truly knocked out of the park. I remember struggling getting to grips with the placement of the elements.

Instead of creating a brand new landing page as a standalone, I decided to focus on making the [landing page for this project](/) a bit more presentable.

## Original Submission

You can see the [original](/projects/old/landing-page), or have a look at [the repo](https://github.com/SQUASHD/landing_page).

Also somewhat amusing to see the class names I used.

```html {1-4}
<div className="second-white-background">
  <div className="blue-call-to-action-container">
    <div className="blue-call-to-action-text">
      <div className="blue-call-to-action-text-header">
        Call to action! It's time!
      </div>
      <div className="blue-call-to-action-text-body">
        Sign up for our product by clicking that button right over there!
      </div>
    </div>
    <div className="sign-up-button white-border">
      <a className="sign-up-text" href="#">
        Sign up
      </a>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

## New Assignment

No separate assignment, just spent time sprucing up the [landing page](/).
