title: Projects
description: An overview of the projects and how the documentation is structured.
---

To prevent myself from going overboard, I will try to approach each project in a structured manner.
I will outline what I saw as the learning objective of the original assignment, what changes I wish to do and outline what I will consider a MVP that I will try to achieve before moving on to the next project.
When I've reached the MVP, I will do a retroactive and outline features that I may want to implement in the future.

## Hosting Old Projects

I will try to transfer old projects and host them here. I will try to keep the original submission "as is",
though a header/navigation bar will be added to make it easier to navigate between projects.
