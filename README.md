# Odin Revisited

An open-source application made with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and other goodies.

> **WARNING** 
> While under development, this project will be hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) though I make no promises to keep it up and running. You may lose your data at any time.

This is a work in progress and will be updated as I go along.

## About this project

I started [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) in August 2022 and completed the full course in no time.
I've come a long way since then and I thought it could be fun to revisit some of the projects and see how I would do them now.

To the extent it makes sense to do so, I will try to follow the curriculum and do the projects in the same order as I did the first time around.
