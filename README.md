# Odin Revisited

An open-source application made with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), the overall layout and implementation of docs and other features is lifted from [Shadcn's Taxonomy project](https://tx.shadcn.com/).

This is a work in progress and will be updated as I go along.

## About this project

I started [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) in August 2022 and completed the full course by November.
I've come a long way since then and I thought it could be fun to revisit some of the projects and see how I would do them now.


## Roadmap

- [x] Setup Project
- [ ] Redo curriculum projects
- [ ] Create documentation for each project

### Curriculum & Objective

I'm redoing the projects largely in chronological order as they first are assigned.
Some assignments are revisited later on so I may just do the final version of those, and some won't make sense to do at all,
ie rather than making a brand new landing page for a fictional company, I just spent time polishing the one I made for this project.
